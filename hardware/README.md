## BREADBOARD VERSION
This schematic is an example of what can be made with cheap ESP32 modules.
<br>WARNING : This circuit may not be powered from minitel and usb at the same time.
<br><br>The DIN connector may be replaced by home made connector from any DIN5 cable.
<br><br>Buck converter is only needed where USB power source is not available.
<br><br>Any buck converter with voltage input range from 6v to 15v with power rating greater than 1 Amps would fit.
<br>An output voltage of 5 volts may also be used in conjunction with ESP32 module regulator; tension divisor on NPN base may be adapted to ensure good transmission.
<br><br>Serial transmission is wired to ESP32 module through RX2 & TX2 pins (usually P16 & P17)

## DEVBOARD VERSION
ESP MINITEL v2 schematic are provided as CC-BY-SA
<br>This hardware includes :
* USB support
* Auto bootmode selection
* Integrated buck converter with fuse protection
* Power management to enable USB and/or minitel plugged at any time
* Serial connection to minitel of course
* And some status LEDs
